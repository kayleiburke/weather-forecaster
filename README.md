# Weather Forecaster üå§Ô∏è

Weather Forecaster is a simple web application that retrieves and displays the current weather forecast based on a provided address. Powered by [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and [Geocodio API](https://www.geocod.io/docs/#introduction), it provides real-time weather updates and caches results for optimized performance.

## üñ•Ô∏è Live Demo
A live version of the site is deployed on Heroku:

- https://weather-forecaster-b11670f11862.herokuapp.com/

## üöÄ Features
- **Search Weather by Address:** Enter any address (U.S. or Canada) to get the current weather details, including temperature, description, and icon
- **Error Handling:** Handles invalid addresses gracefully with user-friendly messages
- **User Interface with Bootstrap:** Clean and responsive design powered by Bootstrap for better user experience
- **API Usage Limits:**
    - **Geocodio API:** Allows 2,500 requests per day and 1,000 requests per minute (_[source](https://www.geocod.io/pricing/)_)
    - **OpenWeather API:** Allows 1,000,000 requests per month and 60 requests per minute (_[source](https://openweathermap.org/price#weather)_)
- **Caching for Efficiency:** Forecast data is cached for 30 minutes based on zip codes to optimize performance and ensure that repeated requests do not unnecessarily consume OpenWeather API calls
    - In **production**, Redis-backed caching ensures consistent performance and scalability across multiple workers
    - In **development**, caching is performed in-memory for simplicity

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage
1. **Search for Weather:**
    - On the homepage, enter an address (e.g., `One Apple Park Way, Cupertino, CA 95014`) or a more general location (e.g., `California` or `Toronto, Canada`).
    - **Note:** The address can be either specific or broad (e.g., a street address, city, or state). However, it must be within the US or Canada, as Geocodio only supports these regions.
    - Click **Get Forecast** to view the weather details.

2. **Caching:**
    - Results are cached for 30 minutes to enhance speed and limit API requests.
    - If you search the same address within the cache period, the app will display the cached result.
